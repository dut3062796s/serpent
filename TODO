So, long story short, we have 2 repos (prior effort and current) and many, many private
branches of this project. Add to that, we have 2 months where we ourselves weren't fully
online with the rest of the world due to various issues, health, etc.

So, let's get this document in order now to organise this months work to get Serpent into
basic demo shape.

 - Let's kill the stupid plane demo and focus on recreating the `lispysnake2d` demo.
 - Bring back parsers for Tiled, but let's just focus on JSON now, not XML (future-maybe?)
 - Bring back parsers for Tilesheet sprites, to get a player on screen
 - Implement tilemap renderer with commonality to sprite renderer.
 - Reintroduce animation framework through the Context Job system (perhaps stage -> static class?)
 - Retain stateful approaches to per-level/stage concepts.
