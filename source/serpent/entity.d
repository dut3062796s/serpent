/**
 * Logically a world (or scene graph) is composed of entities. However
 * in a bid for optimisation we avoid graph behaviours in entity composition,
 * and instead rely on expression of entities as data, leaving the renderer
 * to do its job.
 *
 * In order to optimise for your application, it is recommended that
 * you derive your individual Entity definitions from this class and
 * add any specific data blocks required. For example, you may want
 * to add health aspects.
 *
 * You should mark any overridden methods as *final* as a hint to the
 * D compiler to ensure optimisation.
 *
 * Note: All entities, whether 2D or 3D, have at least 3 axes.
 * These determine the X,Y, and Z coordinates. It is up to the
 * individual renderers and cameras to respect these properties.
