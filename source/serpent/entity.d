/**
 * Logically a world (or scene graph) is composed of entities. However
 * in a bid for optimisation we avoid graph behaviours in entity composition,
 * and instead rely on expression of entities as data, leaving the renderer
 * to do its job.
 *
 * In order to optimise for your application, it is recommended that
 * you derive your individual Entity definitions from this class and
 * add any specific data blocks required. For example, you may want
 * to add health aspects.
 *
 * You should mark any overridden methods as *final* as a hint to the
 * D compiler to ensure optimisation.
